I would like to extend my appreciation to my supervisor, Prof. Ashish Khisti, whose brilliant insights and systematic thinking have profoundly shaped this work. I am grateful for his support during challenging times.

I am also grateful to Prof. Jun Chen, Prof. Aristotle Voineskos, and Prof. Colin Hawco for their guidance and insights, which have greatly enhanced my research. My appreciation also goes to my amazing coauthors, Navona Calarco and Nikhil Krishnan, for their collaborative efforts and contributions.

Special thanks to Prof. Ben Liang and Prof. Alireza Makhzani, members of my PhD thesis committee, for their involvement and input since the thesis proposal.

I am deeply grateful to my familyâ€”my parents, Parvin and Hamid, and my sisters, Elham and Maryam. Their unconditional love and support have been my anchor during this journey. Although they were not physically with me, their warmth and encouragement have always felt close to my heart.

Finally, I thank my best friend and beloved wife, Helia, who has been my steadfast companion on this journey. Her support and love have been a constant source of strength every step of the way.
